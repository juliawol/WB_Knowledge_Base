This repository contains an approach to creating a knowledge base information retrieval system. As a baseline, a simple tf-idf with cosine similarity was performed. As a way to deal with potential missing context, synonyms, abbreviations and special terms in user questions, the system was enhances with FastText and MsMarco encoder.
